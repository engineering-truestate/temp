If you’re looking to invest in an under-construction project in Bengaluru - we’ve put together an exhaustive list of everything a project’s lifespan involves. Right from the time it is conceived

## 1. Before construction starts

- When a project is conceived by a builder - they need to take several mandatory project plan approvals from the BBMP (the municipal corporation of Bengaluru). They might also need clearances from other local bodies like the BWSSB that is responsible for water supply and sewage disposal. 

- Once their plan is approved by all the relevant agencies - they receive a commencement certificate that lets them begin construction.

- Post this - they can start marketing their project along with their affiliated marketing partners. 

- This is done by promoting an EOI - an Expression of Interest. 

- A customer who is interested in applying for a unit in the project can submit an EOI to the builder. This is just a simple application form along with basic customer details like PAN, etc. 

- In some cases - some developers might also take a post-dated cheque.

- However - they cannot take any monetary deposit along with the EOI unless a RERA approval is received.

- RERA is a state-level governing body for the real estate industry. Their approval for a project is mandatory for a developer before they can formally start bookings.

- Once the RERA is approved - customers who have submitted EOIs are allocated units. This is usually on a first-come-first-serve basis.

- Customers are required to put down a deposit at the time of allocation. This can range from 1 to 5% of the value of the property.

- Post this - customers are given an allotment letter. This details out the unit they are allocated, payment schedule details, etc.

- At this time - customers are advised to have a consultant thoroughly vet the allotment letter for any discrepancies, hidden or unfair clauses, etc.

- Customers should also check if the builder has a history of being RERA compliant, for any existing title clearance issues and potential environmental issues. 

- After this - the sale agreement is drawn up. Note that builders tend to draft sale agreements in a one-sided manner. It is highly advisable for customers to have a lawyer and broker go through the agreement and negotiate with the builder for better terms.

- Post signing of the sale agreement - the customer is required to deposit the booking amount - this is usually around 10% of the total value of the apartment. 

- **Note**: For NRIs - this process will not be possible to do in-person. This is why they usually give a PoA (Power of attorney) to relatives or agents in India who can do this for them.

## 2. During construction

- Most customers take a bank loan to pay for their property. To apply for a bank loan - you need to hand over several documents. One of them is a MODT - Memorandum of Deposit of Title Deed. 

- Through a MODT deed, a borrower gives a printed undertaking. It states that they have deposited their property’s title document with the lender out of their free will. The title document deposit takes place in exchange for a loan.

- Once this is done - the payment schedule is activated. Depending on the project and developer - the payment schedule can be linked to time (for eg - monthly/quarterly installments) or construction (for eg - paying a certain amount when 5 floors of a building are constructed).

- At the time of payment - the developer will raise a demand with the bank to release it. The customer and bank will both have to approve the demand for it to get processed.

- Occasionally - either the customer or bank can refuse or dispute the payment - if they feel the developer has violated the terms of the sale agreement.

## 3. After construction is done

- When the construction is completed - the developer applies for an Occupancy Certificate (OC) and Completion Certificate (CC) from the BBMP. These are granted after the building has been verified to be safe for occupancy, and to certify that the builder has not deviated from the original plans that were submitted.

- After this - a khata is created for the entire project, and then generated for every unit in the project. A khata document that proves that the person buying a property has an account with the BBMP for taxation purposes.

- Post this - the developer generates a sale deed for the customer. The sale deed is required to legally transfer ownership of the property from the builder to the customer. 

- With the sale deed done - the khata is transferred from the developer to the customer. Along with the sale deed - this also requires the previous property tax receipts and the encumbrance certificate (a certificate that confirms the property is free from any legal or monetary dues such as uncleared debts or mortgages). Both of these will be provided by the builder. 

- Once the khata is transferred - customers are also required to transfer the electricity bill in their name. This is the final step for customers before they can take possession of their property.

# How to Make Money in Real Estate: 4 Tips for Outsized Returns

Real estate has a powerful potential for generating wealth, but success depends on smart decisions and careful analysis. While many investors see minimal gains, only 1 in 3 manage to outperform the interest rates of fixed deposits. Want to be among the successful minority? Here’s how to avoid the common pitfalls and make money with real estate investments.

## Use leverage

### 1. Choose Projects with Timely Completion for Faster Returns
   - One of the biggest challenges in real estate investing is avoiding projects with delays. A project’s value often grows significantly between the start of construction and the time of possession. Delays can prolong this timeline, affecting your returns and reducing demand as newer, more attractive projects enter the market.

   - **How to Find the Right Projects**: Look for projects by developers with a proven record of timely completion. Opt for projects that are already under construction or have passed key regulatory stages. By reducing the uncertainty of construction timelines, you can maximize your investment’s appreciation without waiting indefinitely.

   - **Return Potential**: When you select timely projects, you’re likely to see faster value growth, keeping you ahead of newer projects in the area. This way, you can capture appreciation sooner, making it easier to secure strong returns upon resale or when renting out the property.

### 2. Invest in Good micromarkets with Strong Development Prospects
   - Real estate investments in “upcoming” areas can yield substantial returns, but only if the area actually develops. Micro-markets on city outskirts may promise high growth due to new offices, industries, or infrastructure, but these are not guaranteed to come through on time. Understanding which areas have strong, near-term development prospects can make a major difference in your returns.

   - **How to Spot High-Potential Areas**: Look for areas with government-approved infrastructure projects, like metro lines, highways, and commercial hubs. Check for companies planning to set up offices nearby, which is a strong sign of future demand. Staying informed about government and corporate development plans can help you find locations primed for appreciation.

   - **Return Potential**: Investing in a strategically chosen micro-market lets you tap into rising demand as infrastructure projects come online. Properties in such areas often see faster appreciation, helping you realize profits sooner as demand catches up with the available supply.

### 3. Avoid Overpaying by Understanding Market Cycles
   - Real estate markets fluctuate between phases of growth, stability, and, occasionally, contraction. One key to making money in real estate is to avoid buying properties at inflated prices, which tend to happen at the peak of these cycles. Buying at a fair price allows you to ride the next wave of growth, maximizing returns.

   - **How to Avoid Overpriced Investments**: Assess property prices relative to historical trends in the area. Look for signs of market saturation, such as too many new projects being launched at once, which can lead to price drops. Properties that are slightly undervalued or priced at the middle of the cycle are better positioned for appreciation.

   - **Return Potential**: By buying at a fair or discounted price, you gain more room for value growth. When prices rise during the next growth phase, your investment will yield better returns than if you’d bought at an inflated price.

## Key Takeaway: Winning in Real Estate Requires Research and Timing

To truly profit from real estate, avoid costly mistakes by doing thorough research on the property, area, and market cycle. By following these three strategies—choosing reliable projects, focusing on high-potential areas, and avoiding overpaying—you increase your chances of seeing returns that outpace other investments.

With careful planning, you’ll be well-positioned to grow your wealth and maximize your returns, establishing yourself as a smart and profitable real estate investor.
