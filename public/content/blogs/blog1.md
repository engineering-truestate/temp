# The Case for Investing in Real Estate

Stories that one has heard about investing in real estate usually go one of two ways.

Everyone knows someone who invested early on in a now-famous address and has made fabulous returns.

And then we all know someone who invested in a project that was delayed by the developer, or never reached its price potential due to exogenous factors (also expressed as - ‘*isse accha return toh FD se mil jaata*’).

So what is the actual case for investing in real estate? Let’s unpack the different layers involved.

## 1. Real Estate as an Asset Class

While real estate in general is a low-risk investment, under-construction projects have a reputation for being very risky. This risk exists because of incorrect claims made by the developer, lack of information regarding legal status of the project, and other issues.

If an investor is able to understand and manage these risks, the risk-adjusted returns in real estate are the highest amongst various asset classes.

Here is a summary of the different types of common asset classes and where real estate stands:

_As one can see, real estate is an extremely advantageous part of a portfolio for multiple reasons - risk-adjusted returns, low volatility, leverage and more. But - the important caveat is that it works best for investors who can afford a larger unit size of investment (more on this in a bit)._

Additionally, real estate accounts for 23% of HNI investments globally but just 10% in India, which implies that it will be an increasing share of the HNI portfolio.

## 2. Growth of the Indian Economy

India is projected to be a global economic powerhouse of the 21st century. But we’ll stick to the specifics that would make the real estate space outpace the economy in general:

### a. Working Age Population Combined with Smaller Families

India’s working age population (15-64) comprises 68% of the population and is expected to peak in 2036. At the same time, the size of India’s households are rapidly decreasing - with 50% of households now being nuclear ones, up from 37% in 2008.

These two trends combined will lead to a demand for residential property that will outpace consumer demand in general.

### b. GDP Growth and Discretionary Spending

India’s GDP is projected to grow at 7-8% over the next few decades. By this estimate, India will reach a per capita income of ~$10,000 in the next 20 years, which will comfortably place it in the ‘middle-income nation’ bracket.

A bulk of the consumer spending at this income level would go towards maintaining a higher quality of life, with a better standard of housing (i.e. paying for larger and better quality apartments) being a fundamental part of this. One lead indicator of this is the large increase in luxury residential units being sold of late, which primarily cater to the segment of population that has reached high-income status already.

### c. Rapid Urbanization Spurred on by FDI

Most of India’s FDI inflows continue to be in the services sector. This sector mostly creates jobs in cities, which will increase India’s already-rapid rate of urbanization.

By 2035, India’s urban population is expected to hit a staggering 675 million (43% of the population), up from approximately 440 million today. This is expected to create a demand for nearly 50 million homes in the next 10-15 years.

### d. Increased Market Share of Organized Players

The real estate market is currently dominated by small players, but that trend is changing quickly. Several large conglomerates have started aggressively launching residential projects in the last few years - this includes L&T, Mahindra, TVS, Godrej, Tata, and others.

This is beneficial for several reasons - the most important ones being less insolvency risk, fewer delayed projects, better construction quality, and higher access to credit.

### e. Better Access to Capital

Home loan penetration in India is still low. Our outstanding home loan as a % of nominal GDP is just 11%, compared to 52% for the US and 68% for the UK. More organized players entering the market, combined with customers with higher credit scores will stimulate large demand for home loan financing.

## 3. Entry Barrier Advantage

Due to the high ticket size involved, directly investing in real estate is largely restricted to HNIs. For example, let’s say you want to invest in a Rs. 2 Cr property. You will need to put an upfront payment of 10%, i.e. Rs. 20 lakhs.

For the remaining 90% (i.e. Rs. 1.8 Cr), you will get a home loan at an interest rate of 8-9%. This will be a construction-linked payment plan which will last for 3-4 years. The EMI will start at ~Rs. 20K and reach a maximum of Rs. 1.5 Lakhs when the project is nearing completion.

So if you’re an HNI with access to this quantum of capital and also reasonably sure about a steady cash-flow over the next 3-4 years, you get several advantages when it comes to dealing with developers with respect to under-construction properties. The leverage you get increases your IRR for the project.

Access to institutional credit is still an issue for even large developers, which means a bulk of their capital still comes from construction-linked payments from individual investors. For this, they are willing to offer favorable terms to investors who take an early bet on their projects.

Plugging into the developer life cycle at the right time can give significant returns just during the construction phase. However, doing a detailed analysis of the project, developer, and micro-market is crucial (*learn more about how TruEstate does this here*).

Following this, investors get a chance to exit (usually in 2-4 years) to buyers who want to move in immediately, or continue to hold the property, with the added advantage of rental yields once the project is ready for possession.

While rental yields in India are currently low, there is a vast difference in yields depending on the quality of projects - even in the same area. Which means picking the right property early on gives investors a double-advantage with respect to net returns.

### Conclusion

So in summary, if real estate is a lucrative investment, why do so many people get it so terribly wrong? And the ones who do get it right - how do they do it? In our upcoming posts, we’ll cover this and more in detail. Stay tuned!
